"America is at its best when we serve as a shining city on a hill, a beacon of freedom and opportunity to people around the world. Our success in this new century depends on reinvigorating our historic mission with determined leadership that gives hard-working American families confidence their future will be better than their past. In the process, we can strengthen our national security and economic security while building a more peaceful and prosperous world." - Mayor Rudy Giuliani

EXPANDING OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

Strengthen America's 21st Century Workforce: Education is power in an information economy. American workers must be the best trained and prepared workforce in the world in order to successfully compete in the global economy. 

* Promote science and mathematics through technical certification or an associate degree. 

* Advance successful training programs leading to competitive skills the market demands.

* Allow early withdrawal from retirement accounts for qualified retraining programs.

* Expand the number of H1B Visas for skilled foreign workers to meet market demand.

Create "Global Prosperity Initiative": Bringing more countries and people into the global marketplace will make America safer and create new markets for our products worldwide. America must promote higher living standards around the world, help reform the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to encourage pro-growth policies, and distribute foreign aid in ways that reinforce good governance and economic freedom, similar to the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

Aggressively Advance Free Trade: Rudy will tear down the walls to free trade and create new markets for American-made products. He will protect America's innovations and intellectual property by enforcing our trade agreements aggressively.

* Reduce corporate tax rates and regulatory burden so that Americans can better compete in the global economy.

* Reform the excesses of Sarbanes-Oxley that are driving our corporations overseas to list on foreign exchanges.

* Reenact the Presidential Fast-Track Trade Promotion Authority and complete the Doha Development Round.

STRENGTHENING OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD

Refocus State Department and Reform Foreign Service: Rudy will set new priorities for America's representatives to better promote U.S. policies abroad, while measuring the success of ambassadors and embassies. He will reform and increase the size of Foreign Service and expand language training to meet the demands of the 21st Century.

Combat Anti-Americanism: America must win the war of ideas. Rudy will reform and refocus our international broadcasters, such as Voice of America, and will better coordinate our government's global communications to help export the idea of freedom and our values, and stimulate debate within oppressed societies.

Expand U.S.-Muslim Exchange Programs: Rudy will promote economic, cultural, and educational engagement with the Arab and Muslim through public-private partnerships to turn the tide against radical Islamic terrorists and connect more countries to the global marketplace of ideas.

Protect Freedom: Promoting religious and political freedom, human rights and democracy for dissidents across the world, along with supporting women's rights and promoting women's education in the Arab and Muslim world, must be a top priority.
