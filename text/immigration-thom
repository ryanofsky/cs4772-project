  Immigration

Read Fred Thompson's Full Immigration Plan

The United States is a nation of immigrants. Throughout our history, legal immigrants have brought energy, ideas, strength, and diversity to our country, our economy, and our culture. This must continue. But in the post-9/11 world, immigration is more of a national security issue. A government that cannot secure its borders and determine who may enter and who may not, abrogates a fundamental responsibility. I am committed to:

    * Securing our borders and enforcing immigration laws. Amnesty is not an option and the toleration of ¿sanctuary cities¿ must end.
    * Reviewing our immigration laws and policies to ensure they advance our national interests.
    * Uniting Americans by welcoming legal immigrants willing to learn English, assimilate into our communities, and become productive citizens.
