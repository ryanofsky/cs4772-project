    Federal Budget and Spending/Budgetary Reform

In a few short years¿not a generation from now¿a fiscal tsunami that could imperil our security and economic prosperity will hit our nation and place an unfair burden of debt on our children and grandchildren. The tens of trillions of dollars in debt that will be accumulated over the next few decades will do immense harm to our economy. This burden is now estimated at $170,000 per person and $440,000 per family. Time is running out to address this looming crisis. We need market-based approaches to reform that guarantee benefits for those who need them and embrace personal responsibility and cost-effectiveness without raising taxes. Given the scope and urgency of this problem, and the burden it will place on our children, reform is not only an economic necessity, it is a moral imperative that requires action now. I am committed to:

    * Opening the government¿s fiscal books on this looming crisis for all to see and understand.
    * Working with individuals of all political persuasions to develop a comprehensive solution to the pending fiscal crisis.
    * Leading and making the hard choices necessary, to include cutting wasteful government spending, to safeguard our security, promote our prosperity, and protect our children and grandchildren from fiscal calamity.

Tax Reform

The U.S. tax code is broken and a burden on U.S. taxpayers and businesses, large and small. Today¿s tax code is particularly hostile to savings and investment, and it shows. To make matters worse, its complexity is a drag on our productivity and economic growth. Moreover, taxpayers spend billions of dollars and untold hours each year filling out complicated tax returns, just so they can send more money to Washington, much of it for wasteful programs and the pet projects of special interests. We need lower taxes, and we need to let taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned dollars¿they know best where and how to spend them. And we need to make the system simpler and fairer for all. To ensure America¿s long term prosperity and economic security, I am committed to:

    * Fundamental tax reform built on the principles of simplicity, fairness, and growth.
    * A new tax code that gets the government out of our citizens¿ pocketbooks, while enhancing U.S. competitiveness abroad.
    * Dissolution of the IRS as we know it.
