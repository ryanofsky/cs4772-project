"All spending is discretionary. Read the Constitution. Congress has to appropriate it; the President has to sign it. All spending is discretionary and it has to be looked at from the point of view of, can we afford it now? Is it appropriate to pass it on to the next generation? This is what I did in New York City. I restored fiscal discipline ..." 

- Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Remarks On 12 Commitments To The American People, Bedford, NH, 6/12/07

 RUDY'S PLAN TO RESTORE FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND CUT WASTEFUL SPENDING

 

Anonymous earmarks, concealed budgeting, and special interests waste taxpayer dollars within the Federal budget. Over the last decade, non-defense spending increased 72%, while the number of earmarks increased from 1,000 to nearly 10,000. Rudy Giuliani will impose fiscal discipline and accountability through a combination of executive action and legislative reform. (The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008, Historical Tables; Citizens Against Government Waste, http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=reports_porkbarrelreport)

 

End Earmarking & Start Budgeting Like a Business: Rudy's plan will make government more honest, accountable, and transparent by making Congress budget more responsibly, like American businesses and taxpayers. 

 

* Stop irresponsible and anonymous earmarks.

* Require mandatory sunset clauses for all Federal programs.

* Require Congressional Budget Office cost estimates for all legislation before it is voted upon.

* Create separate capital and operating budgets.

* Bring generally accepted accounting principles to the Federal government.

 

Reduce the Federal Civilian Workforce by 20% through Attrition and Retirement: Within the next decade, 42% of the Federal Civilian Workforce - some 300,000 bureaucrats - will retire. (Congressional Budget Office, "Characteristics and Pay of Federal Civilian Employees", 3/07)

 

* Replace only half, making the Federal government smaller and smarter through increased use of technology and privatization.

 

* Eventually saving the taxpayers $21 billion each year, while ensuring that the Federal government is focused on performing its essential responsibilities (Congressional Budget Office, "Characteristics and Pay of Federal Civilian Employees", 3/07).

 

Require Agencies to Identify at Least 5% to 20% in Spending Reductions: Requiring agency heads to identify savings and increased efficiencies in each annual budget - as Rudy Giuliani did as Mayor - is a management tool that will lead to constant streamlining and more cost-effective government spending without compromising national security in the search for savings.

Propose a Constitutional Amendment Establishing a Presidential Line-Item Veto: A constitutional line-item veto would allow the President to fight for the national interest by cutting wasteful special interest programs without contributing to gridlock by vetoing an otherwise sound bill.

Use GAPStat to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Federal Agencies & Eliminate Wasteful Spending: Rudy's plan establishes a Government-wide Accountability Program ["GAPStat"] based on New York's successful CompStat program to better evaluate each agency, analyze the effectiveness of Federal programs, and identify those that are wasteful, failing or duplicative. 

* Allows the Office of Management and Budget to evaluate effectiveness in a new way, hold Congress accountable for the wasteful programs it funds, and offer specific solutions to save taxpayer dollars.
