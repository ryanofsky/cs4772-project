  National Security

The first responsibility of government is to protect the American people, the homeland, and our way of life. Today we face the urgent threat of radical Islamic terrorists. Al Qaeda is committed to attacking us here at home, and wants to use weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to kill millions. We must never give them that opportunity. We must defeat the terrorists abroad, and that begins in Iraq and Afghanistan¿the central fronts in this global war. We must show the world we have the will to fight and win. A weakened America - or an America that appears weaker - will only encourage further attacks. We must persevere. As Commander-in-Chief, the president must ensure the United States has the means to achieve victory. Presidential leadership requires talking to the American people about these stakes, mapping out a clear vision for success, and devising a comprehensive strategy for achieving it. I am committed to:

    * A larger, more capable, and more modern military that can defeat terrorists, deter adversaries, and defend the U.S. and our interests.
    * A missile defense system that can protect the U.S. and our allies from long-range ballistic missiles.
    * An enhanced intelligence community, with robust human-intelligence capabilities, focused on terrorism and proliferation.
    * A robust approach to homeland security that will protect our nation from terrorists and WMD, regardless of where they come from.
    * A strengthened system of global alliances to better combat terrorists, proliferators, and traditional threats to our interests.
    * A judicial system that deals with the realities of terrorists and unlawful enemy combatants.

   Government Effectiveness

Our government is outdated, inefficient, and wasteful. It is often unable to perform even the most basic tasks our citizens expect. It is no longer enough just to want limited government; the American people deserve more effective government. Given today¿s challenges, we cannot afford¿and shouldn¿t accept¿anything less than a nimble, effective, and efficient government that is able to focus its resources on the important issues facing our country. It must be able act on behalf of the American people and our national interests in a timely manner. The key to competent government is strong, committed leadership from the top. The key to good government is good people who are well-managed and put the national interest first. I am committed to:

    * Attracting and rewarding the best Americans to serve in government and ensuring they have the authority and resources needed to get the job done.
    * Fixing government accounting so tax dollars are properly spent and the American people know exactly what they are being spent on.
    * Improving government performance by making agencies accountable for accomplishing their missions on time and within budget.
    * Ensuring information technology systems are secure and that they give our government the capacity and effectiveness to get the job done.

  Appointing Judges Faithful To Our Constitution

Activist judges across the country seem intent on legislating from the bench to promote a culture of abortion, redefine marriage, and undermine families¿in effect re-shaping the values of our entire society without the consent of the people.  We need judges who recognize their role in our democracy is to interpret, not make, the law. I am committed to:

    * Appointing strict constructionist judges who will interpret the law, not impose their views on us by legislating from the bench.
