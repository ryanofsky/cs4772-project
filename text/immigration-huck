Immigration

 

    * Securing our borders must be our top priority and has reached the level of a national emergency.
    * I support the $3 billion the Senate has voted for border security.  This money will train and deploy 23,000 more agents, add four drone planes, build 700 miles of fence and 300 miles of vehicle barriers, and put up 105 radar and camera towers.  This money will turn "catch and release" into "catch and detain" of those entering illegally, and crack down on those who overstay their visas.
    * In this age of terror, immigration is not only an economic issue, but also a national security issue.  Those caught trying to enter illegally must be detained, processed, and deported.  As Governor, I ordered my state troopers to work with the Department of Homeland Security to arrest illegals and enforce federal immigration law.
    * I oppose and will never allow amnesty.  I opposed the amnesty President Bush and Senator McCain tried to ram through Congress this summer, and opposed the misnamed DREAM Act, which would have put us on the slippery slope to amnesty for all.
    * I oppose and will not tolerate sanctuaries for illegals.  The federal government must crack down on rogue cities that willfully undermine our economy and national security.
    * I oppose giving driver's licenses to illegals and supports legislation to prevent states from doing so.  In 2005, I signed legislation that prevents illegals in Arkansas from getting driver's licenses.
    * I will stop punishing cities which try to enforce our laws and protect the economic well-being, physical safety, and quality of life of their citizens.
    * I oppose and will not tolerate employers who hire illegals.  They must be punished with fines and penalties so large that they will see it is not worth the risk.
    * I oppose the economic integration of North America that would create open borders among the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  I will never yield one iota or one inch of our sovereignty.
    * I will take our country back for those who belong here.  No open borders, no amnesty, no sanctuary, no false Social Security numbers, no driver's licenses for illegals.

I know that securing our borders must be our top priority and has reached the level of a national emergency.  I am as sick and tired as you are that it is harder for us to get on an airplane in our home town than it is for all these illegals to cross our international border unchallenged.

We cannot stem the tide of illegals until we turn the tide.  Before you fix the damage to your house caused by a leaking roof, you have to stop the leak, which I am determined to do.

I supported the $3 billion Congress passed this summer for border security.  This desperately-needed money will train and deploy 23,000 more agents, add four drone planes, build 700 miles of fence and 300 miles of vehicle barriers, and put up 105 radar and camera towers.  This money will turn "catch and release" into "catch and detain" of those entering illegally and crack down on those who overstay their visas.

 But where is this $3 billion?  The President threatened to veto the bill it was part of!  Now the Senate has again voted for this money as part of the Defense Bill.  I will continue to fight until we get these funds.

In this age of terror, immigration is not only an economic issue, but also a national security issue.  We must know who is coming into our country, where they are going, and why they are here.  All those who are caught trying to enter illegally must be detained, processed, and deported.  As Governor, I ordered my state troopers to work with the Department of Homeland Security to arrest illegals and enforce federal immigration law.

I oppose and will never allow amnesty.  I passionately rejected the amnesty bill that President Bush and Sen. McCain tried to ram through Congress this summer after secret meetings of an under-the-radar cabal of amnesty-loving senators.

I opposed the misnamed DREAM Act, which was a nightmare because it would have put us on the slippery slope to amnesty for all.  Because once we open that door even a crack, we'll never get it closed again.

 I oppose and will not tolerate sanctuaries for illegals.  The federal government must enforce our existing laws by cracking down on rogue cities and towns that willfully undermine our economy and our homeland security by giving benefits and protection to illegals.  The consequences for illegal entry must be swift, certain, and uniform throughout our country.

 I oppose giving driver's licenses to illegals, such as Governor Spitzer tried to do in New York.  I support legislation that would prevent the states from granting this privilege to illegals.  In 2005, I signed legislation that prevents illegals in Arkansas from getting driver's licenses.

I will stop punishing cities which are trying to enforce our laws.  I will appoint judges who will uphold the law, not side with the ACLU against cities like Hazelton, Pennsylvania, which are trying to protect the economic well-being, physical safety, and quality of life of their citizens.

I will not tolerate employers who hire illegals - they must be punished by fines and penalties so large that they will understand it is not worth the risk.  Once again, as with Hazelton, liberal judges are gumming up the works.  Right now, a court in San Francisco  -- Pelosiland - has delayed enforcement of the "no match" letters for Social Security numbers that the Department of Homeland Security will use to crack down on those who hire illegals.  If illegals cannot find work, they will go back where they belong.  I will do everything I can to hasten their trip home by denying them employment.

I strongly oppose the economic integration of North America that would have open borders among the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  I know we must have closed and secure borders.  I will never yield either one inch or one iota of our sovereignty.  I will recognize no authority but our Constitution.

I will take our country back for those who belong here and those who are willing to play by the rules for the privilege to come here.  No open borders, no amnesty, no sanctuary, no false Social Security numbers, no driver's licenses for illegals. 
 


I will Implement a broad-based strategy that commits the resources of the federal government to the enforcement of our immigration laws and results in the attrition of the illegal immigrant population.
