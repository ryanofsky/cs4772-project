    Building Strong Families

Strong families are the bedrock of our nation and our culture.  They are built around the sanctity of life and the institution of marriage, which is the union of a man and a woman.  To counter coarseness in today¿s culture that oftentimes victimizes our children and undermines the traditional values parents want to instill, we must not only protect but strengthen the institutions of family and marriage. I am committed to:

    * Using the Presidency to encourage policies that promote a culture of life, strengthen the institution of marriage and traditional families, and advance freedom of religion.
    * Returning authority to the levels of government closest to families and communities¿the states¿and then protecting states from further intrusion by the federal government, the judiciary, and other states.
    * Combating the spread of obscenity over TV and other media by making sure parents can better exercise their responsibilities.

    Second Amendment

I strongly support the Second Amendment of the Constitution, which protects an individual¿s right to keep and bear arms. Gun control is touted as a major crime-control measure. But some of the places with the strictest gun-control laws also have high violent-crime rates. Disarming law-abiding citizens does not prevent crime. The answer to violent crime is smart, effective, and aggressive law enforcement. The real effect of these gun-control measures is to place onerous restrictions on law-abiding citizens who use firearms for such legal activities as self-defense, sport-shooting, hunting, and collecting. I am committed to:

    * Strictly enforcing existing laws and severely punishing violent criminals.
    * Protecting the rights individual Americans enjoy under the Second Amendment.
