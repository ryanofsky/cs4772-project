  Education

A well-educated citizenry is vital to our security, our economy, and our democracy. Despite the tens of billions of dollars spent on education by Washington each year, and the hundreds of federal education programs now in place, our children are still falling behind, particularly in subjects crucial to the global economy in which we live. At a time when America is behind other developed countries in education excellence, the federal role in education is too intrusive and too bureaucratic, and has become part of the problem. State and local governments are closest to the parents, the kids, and the schools, and best situated to implement changes and innovations that best educate children. I am committed to:

    * Giving parents more choices in education and schools less bureaucracy.
    * Reviewing federal programs for cost-effectiveness, reducing federal mandates, returning education money to the states, and empowering parents by promoting voucher programs, charter schools, and other innovations that enhance education excellence through competition and choice.
    * Encouraging students and teachers to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math¿fields that are crucial to our security, competitiveness, and prosperity.
    * Promoting transparency to assess performance, promote accountability, and share innovations in education at all levels.
